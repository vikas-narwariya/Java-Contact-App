In this Java Contact App I have used some package of java like swings, apt and 
sql database for storing the data of saving adding the contact which we want.

In this app I have created a login system for the user and can access the 
database which he has created by just logging in .

A user can save many details of there contacts person like Name, Number, Email, Address etc.

I am attaching the Screenshot of running app with this.
